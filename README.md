## Let's build a calculator

Using what we know about javascript, we're going to build a simple calculator app.

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**  
- Duration: **2-3 days**  
- Team challenge: **solo**
- Deadline: **18/11/2020 19:00**



# The mission
- Create a new repository named calculator
- Create a calculator.js file.
- Create a file named index.html. In the <body> you can only put an empty <main> tag, and the link to your -  javascript file. The rest of the app has to be generated using your script
- You have to generate a calculator layout with a display on top and all the digits buttons (0 to 9), the operation buttons (+, -, x, /), a button to calculate the result (=) and a button to clear the display (C)


# I used
* HTML5
* JavaScript
* CSS3
* Bootstrap4

# Positif points?

- The key entered gives the result 
- The calculation log works
- The percentage works


# Negatif point

- Brackets don't work.
- I couldn't realise the bonus
